Spigot/Paper plugin developed for the Conlang Club at UW's pidgin formation game v3

## Future work
* Commands that access a players nation, then that nation's dictionary all have some pretty similar code. Maybe a super-class with a default method implementation for getting nation and getting the dictionary config will reduce redundant code.
* Code comments. The plugin was kind of a rush job.
